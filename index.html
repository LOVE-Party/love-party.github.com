	<p>Hey there! You've arrived at the site of the LÖVE-Party! How good for you!</p>
	<p>We are a group dedicated to making <span class="fabulous">fabulous</span> games with the <a href="http://love2d.org/" target="_blank">LÖVE game engine</a>.</p>
	<p>Here's something we've created...</p>

	<p>FoB is a game where you swing bulls to defend yourself against incoming hordes of...other bulls!</p>
	<p>It is currently in development for the 18th Ludum Dare &mdash; "Enemies as Weapons."</p>
	<p>It will feature a single-player survival mode where you have to keep hitting bulls and keep your combo up in order to keep spinning.</p>
	<p>The multi-player mode is a competitive cowboy simulator, where dead players will control some bulls.</p>
	<p>It is due for release before the deadline of the Ludum Dare, so <em>hopefully</em> it'll be available soon.</p>
	<p>If you have any ideas or if you want to beta test the game, join us at #love-party at irc.freenode.net. We'll be there.</p>
